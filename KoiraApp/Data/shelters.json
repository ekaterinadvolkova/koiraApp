Milla is a very energetic girl who needs plenty of exercise, training and activation every day. The girl pulls on the leash and this problem has started to be worked out in the foster home. Makes good contact and listens to commands, is very interested in approaching dogs, however does not show aggressive signs, is more excited about other dogs. Cars or bikes passing by while running can rev up the Milla and try to attack them. Milla is very close to people and really enjoys the company of people, when she is alone she barks, but she hasn't done any damage. Very interested in different smells, so Milla could very well fit into a hobby that requires nose work. Has its own watchdog and barks to announce the arrival of guests. You might jump against the newcomers, and you can unintentionally hurt yourself with your eagerness. Not placed in a family with children due to energy. Milla is looking for an adult home in a detached house, in a quiet residential area, and the new home should have a fenced yard where the girl could not only jog but also unleash her passion for running. The future home must commit to taking care of the dog's daily plenty of exercise, activation and training. The future home is expected to have experience with strong-natured dogs, not to be given away as the first dog.

Carlo is a bit timid towards strangers, needs a little time to get to know him and likes to go at his own pace, treats make getting to know him easier. According to the information, Carlo's pedigree also includes laika, so he is an active young man who enjoys exercise. Gets along with other dogs, most definitely bitches, so Carlo is not placed as a male friend due to possible problems that may arise later. When you gain more self-confidence, cohabitation with another male can become challenging. Also got along with cats who are used to dogs in the foster home. Traveling by car is fine, there is no nausea or noise during the journey. Goes briskly for a run and walks nicely on a leash, some sounds or moving things are still shy. The bitch from the foster home has helped here, from whom Carlo has nicely taken support in exciting situations. In the future home, it would be good to have a social and brave bitch waiting for you, who can help you face new things and wrestle away the bigger energies. The loneliness has gone without any major damage, he likes to move shoes from the shoe shelf to another but has not used them as chew toys. I have never been completely alone in a foster home, but always have dog and cat friends as company. He has also gotten along well with older, already school-aged children, Carlo is not placed in a family with smaller children due to his lack of habit. Carlo is also a tough boy to climb, so the yard fences in the future home should be high enough and protected to prevent climbing over if the dog is kept free in the yard without supervision. Carlo is looking for an adult home with dog experience, either in a terraced house or a detached house in a quiet residential area. The future home must commit to taking care of the dog's daily ample amount of exercise, activation and training. Carlo is clean inside and in a foster home in Pirkkala, where you can get to know the boy as agreed.","shelter_id":"968a39ba-9809-4df6-9da8-3d6599469014","images":[{"id":"4add761b-d232-4a2a-8440-324ff8274b69","url":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaEpJaWt3WlRsaE5XSmpNQzFsWm1ZMkxUUTRNV1l0WW1ReFl5MWtaamxsT1dZME9ERTROaklHT2daRlZBPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--3e2664cddfe19c9145302a438db52d354334369d/Carlo-sivu.jpg"},{"id":"88e454ce-20a6-4033-9817-39c85f851766","url":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaEpJaWsxWmpRMU5EZ3pOeTFtWlRJNExUUXpZak10WWpsbE9TMDNOV1EyWWpaaFpXSm1OV01HT2daRlZBPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--b116b0ed008553292e7b83536818efe2ef9b6dc4/Carlo-uros.jpg"},{"id":"cc12d638-edfa-4494-998c-620b775d27d1","url":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaEpJaWxqTTJFek1EY3dOaTB4TURkakxUUXhZMll0T0RnNE55MDBOR0UwWmpFMU56Um1ZV1lHT2daRlZBPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--4f5ae70a6c9608def463b53928d969a7457540ae/carlo-paa.jpg"}]}]},{"id":"a5f19d80-cb80-4c8d-b598-4e74998b074f","name":"Viikin löytöeläintalo","address":"Koetilantie 13, 00790 Helsinki","email":null,"phone":"040 1980778","url":"https://www.viikinloytoelaintalo.fi/","image_url":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOn1XQCXMYtVCQJ0hK4EcGc1i4pFhXCRZHfQVwM=w408-h544-k-no","icon":"house","latitude":60.2228,"longitude":25.02137,"dogs":[{"id":"a4a5ce32-df79-4351-a957-6513ca2bded3","name":"Minttu","species":"Multiracial","birthdate":"2019-09-02","sex":"female","description":"Sweet multi-breed Minttu is looking for a new home. First of all, I have to say that Minttu is not a normal little dog. Minttu is very shy and it takes time to get used to new people. Minttu doesn't happily jump up to you or curl up in arms, but I still believe that if you find the right person, Minttu can live a very good dog's life if you understand the soul life of a timid dog. The girl gets along with other dogs, a small, calm and social dog friend would be best for Mintu. The girl needs a friend by her side whose example she could follow in normal everyday life. It's also fine with a cat, if the cat is used to dogs. Minttu is not placed in a family with children due to his shyness and lack of familiarity with children. Minttu needs time from its future owner, trust is not won with a couple of treats, but with time. Being alone with the girl goes without any problems, she doesn't do any damage and doesn't make a fuss. Minttu goes outside when asked, but outdoor activities can end very soon when interrupted by a loud noise, in which case the girl's only goal is to get indoors. In the previous home, the walks outside were really short when the dog was almost in a state of panic and the needs came running in circles. For this reason, Mintus had to be given up because life in a busy residential environment is not suitable for the girl and the days were full of stress. Minttu is currently in a foster home in the countryside, where outdoor activities are calmer and the girl is more liberated in a suitable environment. Mintu is looking for an adult home in a detached house in the countryside, and the future home is expected to have experience with very timid dogs. Minttu is clean inside and in a foster home in Pukkila, where you can meet the girl as agreed. In the case of an Ara dog, it would be good to meet the dog at least twice with the future home before the decision to repatriate. The girl is 30 cm tall and weighs a good 5 kg. The mint was originally imported privately from Russia.","shelter_id":"a5f19d80-cb80-4c8d-b598-4e74998b074f","images":[{"id":"fcb2246f-7221-4c97-9788-5a2ec148c0f5","url":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaEpJaWxrWkdVNU1EWm1ZUzAyTlRVMkxUUXhORGt0WVRJellTMHdaVFF5TWpBNFpEWmhNMkVHT2daRlZBPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--590dd8c30a82dff09c43b49161014a59b88439f3/Minttu-kesa.jpg"},{"id":"a9bf8044-6f17-4faf-9eb5-8f5fc13f1379","url":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaEpJaWxtTmpRMVpqRXdNaTAxT1RBeUxUUTBOemd0WVROaE5DMDFORGszTUdWbFltTTFOREFHT2daRlZBPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--05face234682579dc0cff3abb5e58ce2bb8b41f8/Minttu-paa.jpg"},{"id":"8ad75d7e-baba-447f-aae6-ea13d552262b","url":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaEpJaWxqWXprMllqa3pOaTB4T1dGbUxUUmlOR0l0WW1KbFppMW1OV1ptWTJObU5XWTJOallHT2daRlZBPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--d27d1ff14efe1e151fb179a6d2ba8e5188544f2a/Minttu-sivu.jpg"},{"id":"0b1a2210-9d80-48c1-bbcb-dca50d34f801","url":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaEpJaWxoTm1GaFl6SmlNQzA0TmpNNUxUUTFaVEF0WW1WbFpDMDVNemhrTXpJeE1qTmxPVFlHT2daRlZBPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--1ff6c97bbc69bf963ad309f3a7adfe9db667ecba/Minttu-sivu2.jpg"}]},{"id":"dc7b8e58-c641-4846-a5b5-146e25747745","name":"Diego","species":"Bullmastif mix","birthdate":"2015-06-16","sex":"male","description":"Diego, a handsome and friendly bullmastiff mix, pawed at the association to find a home due to a change in his owner's life situation.

Friendly block, with which you sometimes need patience and a sense of humor when the object is the sofa in the living room. In the Lord's opinion, he can stretch out on the couch very widely and the others can go wherever there is room. On a leash, Diego mainly walks nicely, can get a little excited to chase after smells, and this Lord has strength. You don't bark at other dogs on a leash, you can only bark back if the other one starts barking. Alone from the Lord is going without any problems, hasn't caused any damage and waits nicely while the others leave.

Also darts after flying leaves or, inspired by an interesting smell, changes direction to surprise the catcher.

Arma has a high watchdog, so when guests arrive, the boy has to welcome them in his own style, sniffing carefully. After confirming that the visitors are harmless, he goes on with his own activities. Arman came to the association to look for a home due to a change in the owner's living situation. Arman is a very friendly, loyal, pleasing boy who loves active activities. Needs a firm and consistent owner, easily takes the reins into his own paws if he senses that he is getting the better of things and then living together can become difficult if the dog does not listen to his owner. Not suitable as a first dog. Arman does not get along well with other dogs, so he is only placed as an only pet. On a leash, the boy walks nicely, making contact with his handler, but when he sees other dogs, he starts barking. You still need training for using a leash so that overtaking goes smoothly and jogging becomes a relaxed and enjoyable activity for both of you. In the foster home, we have started to train walking on a leash with other dogs for a short distance, after the initial enthusiasm and noises, he is already able to concentrate on receiving commands and walks most of the time by his owner's side without rushing to other dogs. Being alone has gone without any problems, he hasn't caused havoc or barked on his own, plenty of exercise and activation has helped his calm behavior indoors, allowing you to focus on peaceful rest. Arman has been photographed at the vet, which revealed a suspicion of mild cauda equina syndrome, which does not require any measures at this stage. Hasn't been in pain in a foster home, but Armani is not into any heavy hobby. Exercise and light hobbies, such as nose jobs, are highly recommended. Forest walks are pleasant for the boy, a quiet environment with as few distractions as possible, then Arman is at his best. We are looking for an adult home for Armani in a detached house in a quiet residential area, and the prospective home is expected to have experience with German shepherds or other service dog breeds. The future home must commit to taking care of the dog's daily ample amount of exercise, activation and training. Not placed in a family with children. Arman is clean inside and in a foster home in Vihti where he can get to know the boy as agreed.","shelter_id":"f9ea4d84-fa5d-487a-ab2a-1adf5aa339cd","images":[{"id":"bfd8bae3-5bad-451d-b186-da6ff92525a1","url":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaEpJaWt5Tm1GbE5ESXlOeTB3TTJNd0xUUTRZVGN0T0Raak55MHpNRE13WmpOaVl6bGtPREVHT2daRlZBPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--013fb14c34301e566a755c62179b041ccdd643d0/arman-etu.jpg"},{"id":"141e30cb-bc96-4544-85cd-de9d6c53d397","url":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaEpJaWt3WW1ObFpHSXlZaTFpTW1ReExUUXhOalF0T1dJd1pDMWtOVEl5TVRWak1HVmlaRFlHT2daRlZBPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--9c001b738846c7087ab55ac6571ad937770783bd/arman-saku.jpg"},{"id":"0f61a9b3-de71-4cc8-8a46-93a11c600c59","url":"/rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaEpJaWsxTlRWbE1XUTBaUzAyTURVMExUUTVNekF0WWpsbFlpMDRabUpoWldVMVkyVXdNVElHT2daRlZBPT0iLCJleHAiOm51bGwsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--3bc8556ebf4329d5912b106dfe97a3a8d7c368e2/arman-sivu.jpg"}]}]},{"id":"f9339df7-3b63-4657-bd51-99a24417d068","name":"Maria Saari","address":"Keltamotie 7, 01300 Vantaa","email":null,"phone":null,"url":null,"image_url":null,"icon":"pawprint.fill","latitude":60.29126,"longitude":25.027044,"dogs":[{"id":"3f3f3cc5-aa61-4d20-8074-b2b8f2badef5","name":"Iita","species":"Pinscher","birthdate":"2016-07-25","sex":"female","description":"Energetic registered Pinscher girl Iita is looking for a new home.
